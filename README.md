# Java Pattern Programming

This repository contains a collection of Java programs that solve various **pattern printing problems**. Each program demonstrates the use of **loops**, **conditional statements**, and **basic logic building** skills — making it an excellent resource for beginners in Java and programming fundamentals.

## 📁 Structure

Each file in this repository corresponds to a specific pattern problem and is named appropriately for easy identification. The patterns covered include:

- Star patterns (pyramids, diamonds, squares, etc.)
- Number patterns (increasing, decreasing, pascal triangle, etc.)
- Alphabet patterns
- Hollow patterns
- Mirrored or inverted variants

## 🛠️ Features

- Uses only core Java (no external libraries)
- Input-driven: Most programs take `n` as input from the user
- Console output for pattern display
- Great for practicing nested loops and control flow

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `.java` files.
2. Open any file in a Java IDE like IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code.
3. Compile and run the program using your IDE or terminal:
   ```bash
   javac PatternFileName.java
   java PatternFileName
